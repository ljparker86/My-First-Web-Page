        <h1>The Parker Homestead</h1>

        <h2>The House</h2>
        <p>The house was built in the early 1900's. 
            It needs a lot of work, but it has a solid 
            foundation</p>

        <h2>The Barn</h2>
        <p>The barn was full of old cow crap and
            straw. It took a while, and with some help
            from a friend and a tractor, we were able to 
            clean out the main part of it.
        </p>

            <h3>Animals</h3>
            <br>
             <p>We have started off with egg laying chickens,
                but hopefully next year, we will have a couple
                of pigs. I wanted to get goats, but we are not 
                set up for them just yet.
            </p>
        
        <h2>The Field</h2> 
        <br>   
        <p>We have a field lot on the east side of the barn.
            Last spring I tried to make it into a sunflower field.
            However, the birds ate most of the seeds, and the weed 
            took over most of it. Now my plan is to start a garden, 
            and maybe it will grow to most of the field. I also
            plan on putting the pigs out there.
        </p>
